# E-commerce-Back-End-Project

With this app you will be able to add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file.
You will then be able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
I can enter schema and seed commands that will create a development database and you will be able to seed with test data.
WHEN you enter the command nodemon it will start the application.
The server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
WHEN you open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, you will successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
